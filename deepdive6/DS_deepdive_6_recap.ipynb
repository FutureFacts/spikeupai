    "\n",
    "To interpret the min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max values, imagine sorting each column from lowest to highest value. The first (smallest) value is the min. If you go a quarter way through the list, you'll find a number that is bigger than 25% of the values and smaller than 75% of the values. That is the 25% value (pronounced \"25th percentile\"). The 50th and 75th percentiles are defined analogously, and the max is the largest number."
